# CHARPERONE

<hr>
### INTRODUCTION

Aim of the project is to build a device that could guide you to your destination and can get the live feed of the path a user wants to travel prior user reaches that position. It is a flying object with mounted camera and GPS system. A user enters his location on his Smartphone and then Chaperone travels the path and gets the live feed of the path for any obstruction and finally finds the best possible path.

### FEATURE
* Navigator using GPS
* Object Detection via sensors
* Voice Commands

### WHY?

It can be helpful to blind people or tourists or for surveillance as well as monitoring critical operations such as disaster management. It can be help to take picture and videos of self like Go Pro.Guiding users through multiple circumstances like road jam.It can also help in locating terrorist camps in dense forests and finding people in search operations.Its utility can be extended to carry message, package and spy applications.

### INNOVATION

Chaperone can get the live feed of the path a user wants to travel. This device will be able to bring navigation information (that is currently received from various devices like smartphones) to real world.

### SYSTEM ORGANIZATION

* Quadcopter
* Mobile App

### DEVELOPMENT PLAN

* Our primary approach is detecting path from source to destination location. This path be some turning points of quadcopter in between path i.e all actions taken by quadcopter in detail.
* We have to interface quadcopter this specific path. For this quadcopter will need to access its location through GPS and other means.
* Further we will interface the quadcopter with an Smartphone so that we can give details of location and get details(Work on interaction between quadcopter and phone).
* At this point a camera can be integrated to quadcopter to give real time feedback to user.

### Equipment Required

* Quadcopter
* GPS
* Gyroscope

### OUTCOME

By the end of this project, We want to complete a fully working quadcopter interfaced mobile app will have following basic functionalities.

* Providing life feed of path through camera attached to it.
* Finding best possible path from a set of paths blocked by jam or due to some other terrain difficulties.
    * It must also store images of that path we are travelling.
