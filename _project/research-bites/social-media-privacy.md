<hr>
### ABSTRACT
Social Media is being used as a key platform by advertisers to improve business by providing targeted and personalized advertising. There exist a trade-off between productivity in advertising and invasion of user's privacy in the existing approaches. Due to these privacy concerns, there were many law suits filed against the Beacon advertising model used by Facebook resulting in its discontinuation. The similar cases has been also observed with other social media giants.

### WHY?
Currently new approaches tends to address targeted audience while preserving the privacy in order to build appropriate revenue model for their operations but they do not balance them and finally social media owners might suffer loses and can run out of business. In this project, we propose an innovative model that leverage the trade-off between privacy and advertising. The model effectively interacts with user's linked data present in the web structured format(RDF), retrieve it and integrate this data with marketing partner's one. Then it broadcasts the advertisement in social graph with flexible sentences for targeted advertising. Our model maintains interaction records among users in virtual containers for finding tie-strength and also active friends 1 by Association Rules Mining [ARM] algorithm. We applied and validated our approach using a real data set obtained from 506 active social media users.
