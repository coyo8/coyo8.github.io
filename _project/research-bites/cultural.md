# Educational Games in culture teaching

<hr>
### ABSTRACT
With the number of international students coming to USA for higher education rising each year, there is an urgent need to address the problems faced by these students while working as teaching assistants in American classrooms and as a graduate student. A lot of international students are not able to perform the role of TA as expected due to the sharp contrast in the new culture and their home culture

### WHY?
The idea is to come up with a system that is capable of analysing an international TA s’ orientation in the class and try to familiarise him with the intricacies of American classroom culture.The major problems faced by international TA s will be refined into learner goals, around which the game will be centered. The system will be capable of recommending a different set of games, each depending on the learner profile the TA falls in.

Each game will address a specific problem faced by the TA or direct him to a solution for the problem that he faces in American classrooms due to a cultural gap.Some of the solutions perceived by the TA from the game may be a general solution for any TA, to improve his classroom interaction irrespective of which cultural background he/she is from.
