# Open Source Contribution

<hr>

In simple term, Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.

### Why you should care about Open-Source?
Open Source is not confined to programmer or developer. People prefer open source software to proprietary software for a number of reasons, including:

* **Control**: As many people consider source should not be some one private property. OpenSource let to you to examine the code to make sure it's not doing anything they don't want it to do, and they can change parts of it they don't like.

* **Training**: As mentioned, Open source code is publicly accessible, anyone can easily study it as they learn to make better software. Students can also share their work with others, inviting comment and critique, as they develop their skills. When people discover mistakes in programs' source code, they can share those mistakes with others to help them avoid making those same mistakes themselves.

* **Security**: I can summarize this one with [Linus Torvald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) famous quote.

   > "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow"

  it is now considered as [Linus Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_Law).

* **Stability**: Due to ever changing hardware world compatibility becomes impossible task and as software is accessible to more people and it makes them to file bug easy and which lead them to be more stable.


### How To Start?
* The first thing would be to find what seems exciting to you. Open-Source project contribution depends on your motivation and so having exciting projects saves a lot of your will power. I was very much interested in cloud computing and was looking forward to contribute to project related to this field.

* You will be overwhelmed with number of projects you will have to choose from. Here comes the ability to identify what skill sets you have. When I started, I had medium level knowledge of Python and advance C, C++. Python was interesting to me and was looking forward to expedite my skill in it.

* Where to look for the projects?
  *  You can go through entire history of [Google Summer Of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com){:target="_blank"}
  * if you are excited about a particular project then it have high chances of being available on [github](https://github.com){:target="_blank"}.
  * You can go directly to organization website. I was interested in Open-stack and so a quick Google search with string "How to contribute to OpenStack" lead me to this [page](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/How_To_Contribute){:target="_blank"}.

### First Conversation
Most of the organization usually mentions their preferred way of communication i.e. Email, IRC, Slack etc. For Software development related project the best way to contact people at organization is IRC.

Now comes some of the IRC etiquettes. I will suggest you to visit [IRC Etiquette - What to Do, What Not to Do](http://www.ircbeginner.com/ircinfo/etiquette.html). This is the most comphrehensive guide available. I will enlist what I used to do.
* Too much ping is not good. Think like they are developers and they might be busy somewhere and so being patient is the key.
* Direct message is not appreciated. You should ask your questions on the channels. Anyone can pick it up and will help you.
* Make a copy of the conversation so that you should not ask same thing again and again.
* Learn basic IRC commands like /join, /msg, /ping, /quit, /whois, /me

### Bug Fix
* Once you had landed on the IRC channel, you can now ask people ***is there a project available on which you can contribute?***. You can also ask for beginner bugs.
* Another way would be look into their BugZilla and find the person who is assigned or reported to. You can contact the person on the IRC and tell them that you are interested in fixing it.
* If he agrees you are good to go.

### Tools
For Open source contribution, knowledge of this two tools is like a basic requirement. 

* Git
* Linux

There are so many resouces avaialable online for leaning these two.

1. [Linux tutorial](https://www.guru99.com/unix-linux-tutorial.html).
2. [Interactive git tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1).
3. [Learn Git](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git).
4. [Linux for Beginners](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/).
5. [Ryans Linux Tutorial](http://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/).
