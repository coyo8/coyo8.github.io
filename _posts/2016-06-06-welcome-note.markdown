When I told my friends that I bought a domain named *Rudrakos* for blogging and the first question I got was what does the name mean?

The site name, Rudrakos (pronounced “roo d-ruh kohs”) is a combination of two sanskrit words i.e. Rudra (mightiest of mighty) and Kosa (pocket), meaning container of omnipotent.

The name have so heavy meaning... and so I will try with every piece of writing here to be omnipotent. I will be writing about softwares, programming and lifelong learning experiences.



Also if you have some ideas to share, you can publish it here, just [mail](mailto:rahul@rudrakos.com) me.
