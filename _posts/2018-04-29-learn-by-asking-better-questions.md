At this stage; below are the questions which I have compiled by learning from web and books that can help me in asking better questions?

* Why is this idea true?
* Do I really believe it?
* Could I convince someone else that it is true?
* Why didn't the author use a different argument?
* Do I have a better argument or method of explaining the idea?
* Why didn't the author explain it the way that I understand it?
* Is my way wrong?
* Do I really get the idea?
* Am I missing some subtlety?
* Did this author miss a subtlety?
* If I can't understand the point, perhaps I can understand a similar but simpler idea?
* Which simpler idea?
* Is it really necessary to understand this idea?
* Can I accept this point without understanding the details of why it is true?
* Will my understanding of the whole story suffer from not understanding why the point is true?
