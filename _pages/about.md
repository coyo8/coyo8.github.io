## About me

<img class="profile-picture" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/profile.jpg" alt="profile">


Welcome to my virtual realm! Most of my life is about software development but there is much more. I am exploring different things and most of the time I try to deep dive into it them much as possible. I use this blog to share those ideas, knowledge and wisdom; I assimilated during this journey.

I don't have much to showcase here but in past I have had several open source projects ranging with wide variaties of applications(finance, search engine, games, pshycologoy) but these days I am working full time in iOS ecosystem.

I am extremely passionate about computers and how we learn. These days I am diving myself into the history of computation and what it holds for future and currently, I am pondering over this question.

> Does GÃ¶del's Incompleteness Theorem proves that Singularity is not possible?
