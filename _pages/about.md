## About me

<img class="profile-picture" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/profile.jpg" alt="profile">


Welcome to the virtual realm! Though my life is much more than software development but it occupies the most of it. I don't have much to showcase here but in past I have had several open source projects ranging with wide variates of applications(finance, search engine, games, pshycologoy) but these days I am mostly looking for more low level development(programming languages, os, drivers). 

I am extremely passionate about computers and science behind learning. These days I am reading about the history of computation and it what it holds in future and currently, I am pondering over this questions.
